Registered users can select which of these song recommendations he or she likes and save them in playlists.  The user can view, update, or delete any playlists they have created.  Users cannot see playlists created by other users. Any user (even if not logged in) can also view all songs and artists that have been suggested to previous users.  Users can also see all songs that have been suggested organized by artist.
